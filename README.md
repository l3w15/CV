I am passionate about learning and problem-solving, which has led me to study web development. During my studies at Makers Academy I have built various projects whilst learning the best practices of the coding industry, in a progressive and encouraging environment. I'm looking for a working environment which will foster my continued progression in full-stack development and overall learning.

## Skills

#### *Full Stack developer*

I have various projects to showcase my skills in both front and back-end. Some of these projects were started before the Makers Academy course and will continue in future as side projects. I enjoy all aspects of web development and will continue to study and improve. I have a keen eye for detail, developed during my linguistic and language studies, which serves me well as a developer.

#### *Communication and Languages*

As a keen linguist, I am aware that communication is key. I speak fluent French and reasonable Italian. Having worked and lived in various countries I am confident in talking to people from all nationalities and all walks of life. During my time as a teacher I used my communication skills to help others to learn English. These skills were also important to my role at BPA Quality where I was responsible for monitoring the quality of various companies' customer service skills. I was also often invited to work with the clients directly in order to help them improve their relationships with customers.

#### *Team Player*

At Makers Academy I learned about Agile and XP programming while pairing and in group project work. We experienced the value of giving and receiving feedback in order to achieve the best results. Teamwork was also critical to my work as a teacher and while working with clients to start new projects and improve processes in older projects at BPA.

#### *Tenacity*

I am hard-working and self-motivated. I take pride in working to the best of my ability, and take responsibility for my own learning and improvement.

## Experience

#### English Teacher, Globe English Center, Exeter - Summer 2014 and 2017
The range of ability and turnover of students (age range 11-18 y/o) during the busy summer school period required the flexibility to plan lessons  and adapt according to the ever-changing intake of students.

I was responsible for innovative and original lesson planning for my own class. As the students were mostly long-term this involved creating personal learning programmes according to the individual needs and goals of the students.
