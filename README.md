I am passionate about learning and problem-solving, which has led me to study web development. During my studies at Makers Academy I have built various projects whilst learning the best practises of the coding industry, in a progressive and encouraging environment. I'm looking for a working environment which will encourage my continued progression in full-stack development and overall learning.

## Skills

#### *Full Stack developer*

I have various projects to showcase my skills in both front and back end. Some of these projects were started before my current studies but have been included to show my progression. At Makers Academy I have learned best practices such OOP, TDD, MVC, and following SOLID principles in order to self-learn Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails (testing with RSpec, and SimpleCov), JavaScript, Node.js, Express (testing with Cypress, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai and Instanbul) and even building the beginnings of a testing framework (see below).

#### *Communication*

As a keen linguist, I am aware that communication is key. I speak fluent French and reasonable Italian. Having travelled widely and worked in a variety of backgrounds I am confident in talking to people from all nationalities and all walks of life. During my time as a teacher I used my communication skills to help others to learn English. These skills were also important to my role at BPA Quality where I was responsible for monitoring the quality of various companies' customer service skills. I was also often invited to work with the clients directly in order to help them improve their relationships with customers.

#### *Team Player*

At Makers Academy I learned about Agile and XP programming while pairing and in group project work. We learned the value of giving and receiving feedback in order to achieve the best results. Teamwork was also critical to my work as a teacher and while working with clients to start new projects and improve processes in older projects.

#### *Tenacity*

I am hard-working and self-motivated. I take pride in working to the best of my ability, and take responsibility for my own learning and improvement.
